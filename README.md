# Fake-News-Prediction
Fake news prediction system using natural language processing


## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake. The project uses Python and various machine learning libraries to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for training.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement various algorithms to classify news articles.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For natural language processing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
